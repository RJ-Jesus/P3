# P3
Here I'll host most of my solutions to P3 problems.

In case any exercise is missing or you find it wrong please let me know.

As actual lessons about a given subject take place I might update certain exercises if I find a better solution for them.

I decided to include the PDFs for which I solved the exercises at the time as to ensure that a given error is actual because of the code itself and not because of people trying to solve different exercises then the ones I did at the time.
